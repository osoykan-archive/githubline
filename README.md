# githubline

Retrospectively looking at your Github contribution history.

The main reason that I've built this for is seeing that which years I've got something happened to my life. So, you might as well follow the turning points and contemplate about your life :)

## Usage

It works with a `username` and `years` field that you are interested in. Just provide them as comma seperated.

Years can not be less than 2008 which is the Github's start date or greater than current year.

### Example

https://githubline.herokuapp.com/api/contributions?username=osoykan&years=2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,2020

It just gives an `svg` image to put your profile readme or to see how amazing things you've done until now.
